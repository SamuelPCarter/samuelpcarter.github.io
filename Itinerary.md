I'm planning to hike for about 4.6 months. You're welcome to come meet me on the trail and hike for a bit. Bring some good food while you're at it.

All credit is due Craig Giffin for his fabulous PCT trail [planner](https://pctplanner.com/). I would have been hopelessly dateless without it. All dates are subject to change but, oh what the heck, here's the schedule. 

Currently we have completed 246 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail
