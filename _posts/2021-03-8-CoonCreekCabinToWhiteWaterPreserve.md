**Mile 246 to mile 218**

The big money is not in the buying or selling, but in the waiting. 
- Charlie Munger

When my alarm sounded at 0425 I sprang to action. Clothes, Food, Toothpaste all before a 0445 departure to WHite Water Nature Preserve. At 0913 we had started our trek up to Coon Creek Cabin. Due to trail closures we treked up 1250 feet in five miles. I previously remember how bumpy, steep, and curvey this road was in a old Ford F150. At the start I could only imagine what this would be like on foot. At the time these five miles seemed the hardest leg of our section, boy what I wrong.



- Waking up at 4:25 for a 4:45 departure to White water nature presrver
- Started hiking uphill at 9 am
- Previously remember how bumpy, steep, and windy this road was in a car. I could only imagine what it would be like on foot

- Last 7 Miles carrying extra seven or eight pounds on my back
- Finishing just as night fell
- Hiking the three fourths of a mile to get the car
- Tarp Wouldnt stay up throughout the night. Blew down four times
- Snowy conditions were tricky

- Guthook was frustraiting me
- Needed tissues
- Getting a blister and cutting it when I got home
- Saw a bull from hop along infrom of me
- Heard bull frogs and thought it was a microphone system







Whitewater Preserve is 2,851 acres surrounded by the Bureau of Land Management’s San Gorgonio Wilderness and includes the year-round Whitewater Rivr. Rich riparian habitat hosts the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher and least Bell’s vireo, and provides opportunity to see migrating summer tanagers and vermilion flycatchers. The canyon has a robust population of bighorn sheep, deer and bear, and is an important wildlife corridor between the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains. The Wildlands Conservancy purchased an additional 3,200 acres in the Whitewater corridor that were donated to the Bureau of Land Management. These donated lands include sand dunes that are home to the endangered fringe-toed lizard at Windy Point, which lies at the confluence of the Whitewater and San Gorgonio Rivers.
